    "feedback": "EDUCATOR FEEDBACK & ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS\nThe student demonstrates a strong learning process by actively seeking to understand the nuances of MFA, as evidenced by their detailed prompts exploring various methods, their trade-offs, and integration into broader strategies. The engagement level is high, consistently probing for deeper insights. To further enhance their learning, the student could explore specific case studies of data breaches where MFA was either effective or bypassed, and investigate the evolving landscape of MFA bypass techniques and countermeasures. This would deepen their critical evaluation and real-world application.\n\nRUBRIC SCORES\nConceptual Understanding: 10/10 - The student's prompts show a comprehensive grasp of MFA, its components, and its role in cybersecurity, demonstrating deep theoretical understanding.\nApplication to Real-World Scenarios: 9/10 - The student effectively prompts for comparisons of MFA methods and their integration into strategies, indicating a strong ability to apply concepts to practical scenarios.\nCritical Evaluation: 10/10 - The student consistently pushes for an analysis of trade-offs, limitations, and evolving attack vectors, showcasing excellent critical thinking and evaluation skills.\nStructure and Academic Writing: 10/10 - The student's prompts are clear, well-articulated, and directly address the assignment's requirements, indicating strong organizational and communication skills."
